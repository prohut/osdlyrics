===============================

Bus Names
=========

Data Structures
===============

Lyrics Data
-----------
``aa{sv}``

Lyrics are repesented as array of dicts. Each dict in array represent a line of lyric. dicts are in ascending order by timestamp.

Fields of lyrics dict are:

 - id: uint32. Starts from 0 and increases according to timestamp.
 - timestamp: int64. The start time of the lyric text in microseconds.
 - text: string. The lyric text itself.

Lyric URI
----------
``s``

The path of an LRC file. It is in url format. Currently available schemas are:

 - `file:` The lyrics are stored in local file system. The path of the lyrics is the path of the URI. Example: file:///home/osdlyrics/track1.lrc
 - `tag:` The lyrics are stored in ID3 tag of the track. The path of the music file to store the ID3 tag is specified in the path of the URI. Example: tag:///home/osdlyrics/track1.ogg
 - `none:` The track is assigned not to show any lyrics. Example: none:

For compatability reasons, an empty string is considered to identical to `none:`.
